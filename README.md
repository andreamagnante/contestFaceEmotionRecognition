# contestFaceEmotionRecognition
Project for the Computer Vision course - La Sapienza Universit√† di Roma

Implementing an Android app to recognize face emotion after looked a photo. Microsoft Azure services (face recogntion - emotion recognition) are used to evaluate people's mood.

GOAL: Dwelling only on face can lead to an evaluation mistake. An emotion derives not only from the face but also from the context around us.
